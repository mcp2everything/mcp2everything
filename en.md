# MCP2Serial  

Seamlessly connect physical devices to AI models via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling intelligent control and interaction.  

## **Vision**  
MCP2Serial aims to create a platform where:  
- **Natural Language Control**: Operate hardware with conversational commands.  
- **Real-Time Response**: Adjust device parameters dynamically based on AI insights.  
- **Intelligent Execution**: Equip devices with the ability to understand and perform complex tasks.

## **Key Features**  

### **Smart Serial Communication**  
- Auto-detect and configure serial devices (manual selection supported).  
- Multi-baud rate support (default: 115200).  
- Real-time status monitoring and error handling.  

### **MCP Protocol Integration**  
- Full support for Model Context Protocol.  
- Resource management and tool invocation.  
- Flexible prompt system.
